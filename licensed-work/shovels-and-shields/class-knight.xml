		<description>
			<p>Long have tales been told of brave knights that wander the earth in search of riches and glory. Whether they wield an arsenal of arcane items or a modest shovel, these brave warriors wielded legendary weapons and relics against foe, undead, and dragon alike. From the shield guardian to the strangely shovel'd champion, these knights hope to make a name for themselves.</p>
			<h4>ADVENTURES AT HEART</h4>
			<p>At the dawn of the new age, when the wilds were still untamed, the lands were roamed by knights. To this day, they are often found in the wilderness or deep in the heart of dungeons, looking for their next big adventure with seldom a worry for their own safety. A forest full of monsters and longforgotten temples is but another location for them to plunder, and add to their growing legend.</p>
			<p class="indent">Knights are a breed of adventurer unmatched in their unwavering loyalty to their cause. Similar to a paladin's devotion to spreading the good of a deity, a knight is born for adventure and glory. Often found with an arsenal of gadgetry at their side, these dungeon delvers won't rest in their pursuit of unending discovery. Despite their appearance, they rarely wear armor that is truly heavy, knowing that balancing movement and sturdiness is important.</p>
			<h4>BECOMING A KNIGHT</h4>
			<p>Knights of this class are not simply ordained by Royalty, but are driven by higher purpose. Recognized by their strength and deeds from town to town and spoken of in title more than in name. Their hopeful spirit keeps them sprinting into the heat of battle, whether to defend allies, or meet foes. While some are made for the battle of words, knights often shine in dextrous physical combat, and are rarely skilled with the arcane. With the sacred magic of Ichor, some are imbued with powers that awaken artifacts at their disposal or expand their own abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent">When deciding to play as a knight, think about what sort of legend your knight seeks. Are they questing to find a holy relic for a kingdom in peril? Perhaps saving their beloved from a wicked enchantment? Or could they be hoping to garner a collection of similarly powerful adventurers, and establish their own order of knights? It's important to establish a purpose for a knight as it can be central to the theme of the character.</p>
			<h4>GLORY AND PURPOSE EVERLASTING</h4>
			<p>Knights are often full of conviction but vary in all other traits: Many have a strong sense of honor and justice; others are errant, greedy, or troubled. Knighthood is a calling not suited to the weak of heart and great tragedy has befallen those who have refused the call, or abandoned it when things became bleak. Though not holy in their magical origin, knights may be a beacon of hope for the weak. A symbol of purpose for the lost. And a shovel for those in need of a shovel. I'm not one to judge.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A KNIGHT</h4>
			<p>When designing a knight, try to take an object, concept or theme and associated it with the word "Knight". For example, an undead character who once served a powerful count and is now cursed to stalk the shadows until the day they're laid to rest might be known as Endless Knight. Were they given their title by a king? Maybe they're known simply as the Royal Knight? Perhaps it's Goblin Knight? Roaming the lands in search of that most foul creature that burdens the good folk of the land. The Flower Knight may be known for a dandelion attached to their breastplate at all times. Finally, should they complete their quest, will they return to the world they once knew, or seek out new adventures in the wider world?</p>
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can establish a Knight quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score into Dexterity, as most knights have learned quickly that a heavy knight is only as safe as they are quick. Your next highest ability should be Wisdom in order to empower relics and secondary abilities. Then, choose the Code of Shovelry. Finally, take the Retired Adventurer background.</p>
