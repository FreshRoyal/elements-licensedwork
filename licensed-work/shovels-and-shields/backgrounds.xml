		<description>
			<p>The Order of No Quarter is a villainous group of knights created by the Enchantress for her nefarious purposes. In addition to their individual skills in combat, each knight has a specific role in the Order, and loyal minions under their personal employ. You found yourself among their rank for a time, and perhaps you still ally yourself with them.</p>
			<p class="indent">Ask yourself what brought you to the Order? Who are the other members? Do you share a true common goal, or is it an alliance of convenience?</p>
