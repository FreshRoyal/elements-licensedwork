			<p>Long have you sworn off traditional weaponry in pursuit of the elegant art of shovel work. While some find joy in hacking away at monsters with a sword, you have dedicated yourself to making the most of a tool that uplifted the foundation of civilization: A shovel. While you may adapt to situations with the help of your many relics, when all else fails, your spade is what you can truly depend on.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 3rd Level, you can use your action to attempt to shovel drop. Make a two-handed attack against a creature within 10 feet as you drop down onto it with your shovel. On a success, roll for damage as normal. You may make another attack against the same target or an adjacent target within 10 feet, up to three times. On a hit, you deal 1d8 + Dex piercing damage. You may choose to perform up to 2 additional shovel bounces. On each successive drop, you deal one die tier lower in damage (1d6, 1d4) without the Dex modifier. If you miss, you may spend 1 Ichor to heighten your senses and avoid falling prone, as you land within 5 feet of your target and lose your next bonus action. While traveling by Shovel Drop, you ignore difficult terrain. When you end this ability voluntarily, choose a space within 10 feet of your target to land.</p>
			<p class="indent">Beginning at 8th level, the amount of times you can drop increases by one and the damage die starts at a 1d10 instead of a 1d8.</p>
