# elements-licensedwork
\This repo is for implementations for Aurora of content that would be considered official (or pseudo-official) for the series involved, but would not be considered official by WotC.

Basically, it's for cases of creators or companies producing or licensing 5e options without WotC being involved.

# Content Included and Reasoning

[Shovel Knight: Shovels and Shields](https://adamcohen.myportfolio.com/shovel-knight-bringing-platformers-to-tabletop): Yacht Club Games (developers of Shovel Knight) commissioned this for an April Fools blog post.

[DOOM Eternal: Assault On Armaros Station](https://archive.org/details/doom-eternal-assault-on-armaros-station/mode/2up): Matt Mercer created this module for a ZeniMax-sponsored one-shot. It was later released as a paid licensed PDF on the Critical Role store.

# Content Planned

[League of Legends: Campaign Handbook](https://orkidian.itch.io/dnd-leagueoflegends): Orkidian originally started this project as a piece of fanwork, but they now work for Riot Games (developers of LoL). This would make her supplement "pseudo-official".
